dotfiles
--------
This repository contains the dotfiles I use on my machines.

I borrowed a lot of ideas on how to setup this repository to share from
[holman's repository](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)

How to setup
------------
- `git clone git://github.com/russellcardullo/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `rake install`

This will create a symlink in your home directory for anything under .dotfiles/ ending in `.symlink`
